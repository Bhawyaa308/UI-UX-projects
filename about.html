    <p>Hi, I'm Bhawyaa Garg, a Computer Science student at Thapar University.
I have hands-on experience in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've built projects like a Spotify clone, Flipkart clone, and a personal portfolio website. I’ve also worked in a team on a Flight Management System using SQL, PL/SQL, and Node.js, where I contributed mainly to the frontend and database logic. I'm expanding my skills in DBMS, OOPs, C++, and Python.</p>
